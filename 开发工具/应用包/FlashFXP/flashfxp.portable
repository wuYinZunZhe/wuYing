This file forces the FlashFXP install to run as a portable install. In function
this is the same as running FlashFXP with the command line flag -portable.

Just delete this file to be able to run FlashFXP in normal mode. Portable mode is
designed to ignore registry entries and only use the FlashFXP data folders found
within the same folder as the flashfxp.exe file. Normal mode will attempt to use
the computers registry entries to locate the data files including license key and
may also create new registry keys.
